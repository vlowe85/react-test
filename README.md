Further considerations with more time
- Improve test coverage
- Implement react-router for navigation
- Implement with TypeScript for type safety & Interfaces, this will reduce errors and make the code easier to read
- Improve design to match spec from design team, improve responsiveness for mobile / tablets
- Implement debug mode / logging / improved error handling
- If the app was going to scale, extract Http service for network calls, structure files in subfolders
